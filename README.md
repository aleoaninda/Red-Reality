Introduction
Welcome to Red Reality, a top down 2D horror(!) puzzle game. In this game, you are trapped in an alternate reality where it’s devoid of everything except for you, the machine and some mysterious log entries. These log entries tell you the story of a missing scientist called Dr. Robert Scranton, who accidently got trapped in this reality. You need to read the log entries to find hints that will allow you solve the numerical puzzle embedded within the machine. Upon solving all the puzzles correctly, you may (or may not!) escape this reality.
Features
The player character has standard movement system that allows you to navigate the area and collect items such as stamina and log entries. After collecting the logs, the player can go to their inventory and view the logs written by the missing Robert Scranton. These logs have hidden clue to solving the puzzle. Upon solving the puzzle, the red zone in the map will expand. However, solving it incorrectly will shrink the red zone.

An implementation of predator mechanics and dynamic allocation of log entries is ongoing and will be added to a future build of the game.
